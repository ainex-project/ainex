## System Requirements

See [here](/faq/#system-requirements).

## Overview

Ainex is an Xbox 360 emulator research project. It can play a large chunk of the Xbox 360 game library to varying degrees of success.

## Project Origin

The project was forked after [Rick](https://twitter.com/gibbed) suggested that if Xenia did not meet
[Caroline](https://twitter.com/ha1otroop2288)'s standards, she should just fork the project.<br/>
![Rick's message](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30361266/150946698-4cb01f66-a7c4-4aa7-a042-87e8b8cff364.png "Rick on Discord, saying \"I'm sorry I don't meet your standards. Feel free to fork Xenia.\"")<br/>
At first the idea seemed silly. Of course she couldn't do it alone.
The project would need lots of support from other contributors to work. But she gave it some thought.
She heard multiple reports of contributors not being satisfied with the handling of the project,
so she decided that it was worth an attempt after all.<br/>
Caroline would start the project immediately and see whether it caught on.

## Why?

Because the contributors of this project deserve better handling,
better ability to affect the outcome of decisions,
more engagement with pull requests, and faster resolution.

## Future Plans

The future plans for the project will be discussed in the project's [Request For Comments](https://github.com/ainex-project/RFCs) repository.
Merged RFCs are confirmed to be goals, while pull requests are used for discussion.
