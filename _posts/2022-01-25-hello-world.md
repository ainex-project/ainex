Hello world! This is a brand new site dedicated to [Ainex](https://github.com/ainex-project), the community-driven fork of [Xenia](https://github.com/xenia-project)!

Ainex aims to take the good old Xenia emulator, and enhance it with contributions from the community.
Democracy is the goal, so no *one person* gets complete say over the decisions of the project.

As Ainex is a fork of Xenia, you might be interested in viewing the posts on [the Xenia website](https://xenia.jp) for more information on this history of the project.
